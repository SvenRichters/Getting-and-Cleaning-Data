##Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the authores captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## R Script
The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps in the assignment



First, all the similar data is merged using the rbind() function. By similar, we address those files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
Then, only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
As activity data is addressed with values 1:6, we take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt and they are substituted in the dataset.
On the whole dataset, those columns with vague column names are corrected.
Finally, we generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type (30 subjects * 6 activities = 180 rows). The output file is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded to this repository.
Variables
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activities variable.
all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
Finally, averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
